Java-Extended-Dodgsons-Doublet
==============================

Java, Node Tree, Breadth First Search


This is a fairly simple program written to show a proficieny in several programming techniques.
The basic idea behind Dodgson's Doublet is that two words of the same length can be connected with
a series of 'adjacent to' words.
For example: hate → love: hate, have, hove, love.

If you change one letter off the original word, and the new word is valid, then the two are adjacent. Hate → Have.
'Have' then becomes the original word, and the same technique is applied.
The extension onto this idea is simple; my program incorporates words of different lengths.
For example: flour → flower: flour, lour, dour, doer, dower, lower, flower
